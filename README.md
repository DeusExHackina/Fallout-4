Fallout 4 cheat stuff (console cmd and farming)

Level 157 coz that just ended up being it. No exploration done except to get Dog from the Red Rocket and assign him to Sanctuary so he can play with his toys instead of coming with me to get shot at. No quests completed except Out of Time. Crafting material quantities, carry weight, HP, Action Points are all cranked up. An unholy amount of Legendary gear farmed using console commands to import Legendary enemies by the hundred. Bunch of power armor. There's sentry guns all over Sanctuary because that place is always getting attacked.
