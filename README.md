Fallout 4 cheat stuff (console cmd and farming)

This IS somewhat disorganized and I probably won't clean it up. :P When in doubt, Use The Most Recent Version. I'll try to ID stuff by savefile name but eh. =^_^=


Save1_A22D40DD - Summary: bunch o' stuffs plus Marine Armor


Save115_A22D40DD, Save177_A22D40DD - Summary: bunch o' stuffs

I have all the DLC and I don't know how that will affect you if you don't have it. There's nothing "hacked" about these save, I just used console codes to give myself far more resources and action points and hit points and carry weight and probably something else, than you could ever possibly have. The character starts at level 157 coz I wanted something around that level. No exploration done except to get Dog from the Red Rocket and assign him to Sanctuary so he can play with his toys instead of coming with me to get shot at. No quests completed except Out of Time. Crafting material quantities, carry weight, HP, Action Points are all cranked up. An unholy amount of Legendary gear farmed using console commands to import Legendary enemies by the hundred. Bunch of power armor. There's sentry guns all over Sanctuary because that place is always getting attacked. All the robot parts for the robot workbench should be unlocked, just go find Ada. :) If they're not unlocked I musta forgotten and we'll see if I remember next time. :P
